# Engineering_Design_App

This repository includes code written to create a mobile application that makes use of the ThingSpeak API for the purpose of creating a 'smart' waste tracking bin.

This code was written for the purpose of completing the course 4WBB0 - Engineering Design at the Technical University of Eindhoven.

This repository will be public only until the grading period for the course is open. Once grading is finished the repository will once again be set to private.
